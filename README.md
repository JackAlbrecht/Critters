# Critters
Critters is a program to demonstrate a program with a pre-existing main method, where we must create classes to interact with the program. This allows us to create several critters for a critter simulation game!

This program uses 12 classes, the 4 I created are as follows:
- Bear: This critter can be white or black, is represented as a slash or backslash and likes to turn left when it hits a wall.
- Giant: This critter is always gray, is represented as fee, fie, foe, or fun, and likes to turn right when it hits a wall.
- Lion: This critter can be red, green, or blue, is represented by the letter L, and likes to turn left when it hits a wall but turns right when it hits another lion.
- Orca: This critter is black, is represented as "JAWS", and likes to turn left when a wall is to the right or in front of it, and turns right when another orca is in front of it.

Using these classes we are able to add critters to the simulation and see which critter is left standing when the simulation is over.

Thank you for checking out my program,
